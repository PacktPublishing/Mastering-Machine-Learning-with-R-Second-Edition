# Mastering Machine Learning with R - Second Edition
This is the code repository for [Mastering Machine Learning with R - Second Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/mastering-machine-learning-r-second-edition?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787287471), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
This book will teach you advanced techniques in machine learning with the latest code in R 3.3.2. You will delve into statistical learning theory and supervised learning; design efficient algorithms; learn about creating Recommendation Engines; use multi-class classification and deep learning; and more.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
> bestglm(Xy = biopsy.cv, IC="CV",
 CVArgs=list(Method="HTF", K=10,
 REP=1), family=binomial)
```

As R is free and open source software, you will only need to download and install it from https://www.r-project.org/. Although it is not mandatory, it is highly recommended that you download IDE and RStudio from https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/.
